    "also complementarity kernels, which means that the edge probability\n",
    "between two nodes is an increasing function of the distance between them.\n",
    "But for this to make sense, the nodes have to be positioned on a compact manifold\n",
    "(e.g. a sphere or a torus), so that the maximum distance between two nodes is \n",

    "in particular to model both complementarity and similarity driven relationships\n",
